    Hello World!

<a id="motivation-and-description" class="anchor" href="#motivation-and-description" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Motivation and Description</strong>
</h2>

<p>The huge and rapidly increasing amount of structured and unstructured data available on the Web makes it both possible and necessary to support users in finding relevant information. The trend moves more and more towards smart knowledge services that are able to find information, aggregate them, draw inferences, and present succinct answers without requiring the user to wade through a large number of documents. The novel avenues made possible by knowledge services are numerous and diverse, including ubiquitous information access (from smartphones, tablets, smart watches, etc.), barrier-free access to data (especially for the blind and disabled) and knowledge discovery. Over the last years, several challenges and calls for research projects have pointed out the dire need for pushing natural language interfaces. In this context, the importance of Semantic Web data as a premier knowledge source is rapidly increasing. But we are still far from having accurate natural language interfaces that allow handling complex information needs in a user-centric and highly performant manner.</p>

<p>The development of such interfaces requires the collaboration of a range of different fields, including natural language processing, information extraction, knowledge base construction and population, reasoning, and question answering.</p>

<p>This workshop aims to join four communities from the areas of question answering over structured knowledge bases, knowledge base construction for question answering, and NLP annotation for knowledge extraction, both from Europe and Asia: the Open Knowledge Base and Question Answering (OKBQA) community (<a href="http://www.okbqa.org">http://www.okbqa.org</a>) rooted in the Exobrain project (<a href="http://www.exobrain.kr">http://www.exobrain.kr</a>), the W3C community group for Natural Language Interfaces for the Web of Data (<a href="https://www.w3.org/community/nli/">https://www.w3.org/community/nli/</a>), the Question Answering over Linked Data (QALD) community (<a href="http://qald.sebastianwalter.org">http://qald.sebastianwalter.org</a>), and the NLP annotation and resources community from the Newsreader project (<a href="http://www.newsreader-project.eu">http://www.newsreader-project.eu</a>).</p>

<p>The main goal of this workshop is to join forces in the collaborative development of open frameworks for knowledge extraction and question answering, to share standards, and to foster the creation of an ecosystem of tools and benchmarks.</p>

<p>The workshop will therefore not only comprise short and long paper presentations but also a hands-on session on already existing frameworks, standards, and benchmarking campaigns, as well as a social meet-up.</p>

<a id="format" class="anchor" href="#format" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Format</strong>
</h2>

<p>The first half of the day will be comprised of long and short paper presentations on the workshop topics, opened by a keynote speaker with experience in linking computational linguistics and Semantic Web research. The second half of the day will be devoted to demo papers, panel discussions and hands-on sessions.</p>

<p>We expect participants from communities related to the following fields: NLP annotations and language resources, question answering, knowledge extraction and machine reading, and linked data and Semantic Web.</p>

<p>In addition, we plan a social meet-up on the evening after the workshop. It will be held in an informal setting and will be open for everyone, including presenters and interested participants from industry and other communities.</p>

<p>The workshop will also be coupled with an OKBQA platform for sharing the current status of the OKBQA question answering framework (<a href="http://www.okbqa.org">http://www.okbqa.org</a>) as well as discussing ideas for future developments.</p>
